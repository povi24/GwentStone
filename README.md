# Getting Started


The project aims to simulate a 2-player card game, similar to Hearthstone. It allows players to choose a deck of cards, place cards on the table, attack the other player's cards and use different abilities of each card. The drawing below shows the game table and the position of each player relative to it.

### Project structure

* src/
    - checker/ - checker files
    - fileio/ - contains classes used to read data from the json files
    - main/
        - Main - the Main class runs the checker on your implementation. Add the entry point to your implementation in it. Run Main to test your implementation from the IDE or from command line.
        - Test - run the main method from Test class with the name of the input file from the command line and the result will be written to the out.txt file. Thus, you can compare this result with ref.
    - gwentstone/ - contains the flow of the program
        - debugcommands - contains classes used for debugging, as well as printing the required output
        - environment/ 
    - input/ - contains the tests in JSON format
    - ref/ - contains all reference output for the tests in JSON format
